Build something in React so you are continuously being challenged about building a stateless or stateful component.

Create a class and add methods for reuse.

When you declare a class its automatically in strict mode, this was introduced in ES5.

**Remember only one constructor a Class**

A constructor builds an initial object for us.

To extend a class to create a new one do it one at a time, normally its fine. Can also use Mixins.

This is not inheritance, but composition.
